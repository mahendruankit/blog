            content: '$10m is the largest bounty ever offered for the arrest of a specific cyber-criminal.The ignominious record was previously held by Maksim Yakubets, the alleged mastermind behind another ransomware gang called Evil Corp.The US named and shamed him (along with help from the UK authorities) in 2019.Before that, the record bounty stood at $3m for another alleged cyber-crime boss called Evgeniy Bogachev.The thing these individuals have in common? They are thought to be living care-free lives in Russia safe from any prospect of arrest from the local police, who routinely ignore western accusations against Russian hackers.Even with their names, pictures and a rough location published by the US, these alleged criminals are safe.The US seems to have even less to go on in terms of unmasking DarkSides leaders, although most research suggests they are also in Russia.So, despite the eye-watering sums being offered by the US, the chances of these criminals facing justice are slim.',
