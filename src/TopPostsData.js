          'This week, I travelled back in time to visit the future.It has been about 10 years since I first entered the virtual world of Second Life, arguably the internets first attempt at what every tech giant is now racing to build: the so-called metaverse.The term metaverse was coined in the 1990s in a science-fiction novel, Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality successor to the internet, where people live large portions of their lives in virtual environments.Second Life peaked in the late 2000s with millions of users and hundreds of excitable headlines about people devoting hours of their daily lives to live digitally.Since then, I assumed it had died a slow and quiet death. But how wrong I was.The platform seems to have a small, loyal and potentially growing community of "residents", as they call themselves, logging on to experience what our metaverse future could look like.So for this weeks Tech Tent podcast, I dipped back in.',

          'The education secretary will also confirm plans to pilot "energy pods" that can replace gas and coal boilers to supply a schools heating and hot water without carbon emissions. The pods are being tested in some schools first and could be rolled out more widely to other public-sector buildings if successful.Mr Zahawi said that all new schools being built in the country, including 50 this year, would have "net zero in operation".Schools, colleges and nurseries are also being encouraged to improve the biodiversity of their grounds.And from next month, all further education teachers trained via an apprenticeship will be required to integrate sustainability into their teaching.The measures are form a draft sustainability and climate change strategy. These measures will be built on over the next six months - in collaboration with young people, teachers, sustainability experts and environmentalists - before a final strategy is published in April 2022.',

          'A dream cast of Sharon Horgan and James McAvoy unite to star in this lockdown comedy-drama about a husband and wife forced to evaluate their relationship when the COVID-19 pandemic forces them into a confined space for what seems like an infinite amount of time. “I hate your face,” says James’s ‘He’ to ‘She’ and that sets the template for a clever, witty situation comedy which feels a little like a stage play —in the best way— about how our lives and relationships have been strained and changed forever by coronavirus. Directed by the esteemed Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliot), viewers be warned: for some couples this may be too close to home.',

          'Kenya will in mid-November stop the export of Hass and Fuerte varieties of avocados to prevent the harvesting of immature crops. The ban will then be reviewed in January. This will however not affect other varieties and those who harvest off-season, Head of Horticulture Directorate Benjamin Tito is quoted by Kenyas Business Daily newspaper as saying. The ban was brought in after traders started picking immature produce to capitalise on the high prices in the market. The move is expected to have an impact on the prices and availability of avocados in overseas markets.',
